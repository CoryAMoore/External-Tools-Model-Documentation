# External-Tools-Model-Documentation
This repository includes everything that is needed in order to run the External Tools capability in Power BI Desktop and generate Model Documentation. 

In case you run into issues, kindly check the FAQ page first. There are some things you might run into, as some functionality is depending on your local Power BI settings to work. I try to add all possible issues there including how to solve them. You can find the FAQ in the Wiki setting on top, or direclty go to https://github.com/marclelijveld/External-Tools-Model-Documentation/wiki/2.-FAQ
